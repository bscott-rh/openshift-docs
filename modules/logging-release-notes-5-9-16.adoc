== Bug fixes

* Before this update, log forwarding failed when the cluster-wide proxy configuration included a URL with a username containing an encoded `@` symbol, for example, `user%40name`.
This update adds the correct support for URL-encoded values in proxy configurations and resolves the issue.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-6963[LOG-6963]

* Before this update, Vector sent a single message twice to syslog after reading it due to an issue in the log forwarding configuration.
As a consequence, duplicate syslog messages were sent, causing increased network usage and resource consumption.
With this update, Vector sends a single message to syslog, reducing network usage and improving server performance.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7008[LOG-7008]

* Before this update, Vector overwrote the defined log type when writing to syslog if the log message included a `log_type` field.
With this update, the `.message` field is replaced only if it contains a valid JSON string. This ensures that structured data is handled correctly and nested fields are preserved during syslog encoding.
As a result, the defined log type is preserved.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7009[LOG-7009]

* Before this update, Vector duplicated fields inside a log message when forwarding logs to syslog.
This led to redundant data in the output.
With this update, the `.message` field is replaced only if it contains a valid JSON string, ensuring that structured data is handled correctly and preventing field duplication during syslog encoding. 
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7010[LOG-7010]

* Before this update, `ClusterLoggingForwarder` spec validation failed with a nil pointer runtime error when the `outputRef` field in a pipeline did not have a corresponding output defined or had an output with no name.
With this update, the validation function has been fixed, preventing the Operator from crashing and ensuring continuous logging service.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7191[LOG-7191]

* Before this update, parsing the `.message` field as JSON could generate logs at the `error` level even when the issue was not critical.
With this update, the messages are logged at the `debug` level, reducing log noise and still allowing for debugging when needed.
link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7232[LOG-7232]

* Before this update, the histogram in the *Observe > Logs* page did not update its time range even after being manually refreshed.
With this update, the correct time range is set and the histogram shows updated data when refreshed.

== Known issues

* When you forward logs to a syslog output, the produced message format is inconsistent between Fluentd and Vector log collectors. Vector messages are within quotation marks; Fluentd messages are not. As a consequence, when migrating from Fluentd to Vector, users might experience issues with their tool integrations.  (link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/LOG-7007[LOG-7007])
