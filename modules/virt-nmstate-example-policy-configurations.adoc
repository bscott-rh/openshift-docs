= Example policy configurations for different interfaces

Before you read the different example `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest configurations, consider the following factors when you apply a policy to nodes so that your cluster runs under its best performance conditions:

* If you want to apply multiple NNCP CRs to a node, you must create the NNCPs in a logical order that is based on the alphanumeric sorting of the policy names. The Kubernetes NMState Operator continuously checks for a newly created NNCP CR so that the Operator can instantly apply the CR to node.

* When you need to apply a policy to many nodes but you only want to create a single NNCP for all the nodes, the Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the policy to each node in sequence. You can set the speed and coverage of policy application for target nodes with the `maxUnavailable` parameter in the cluster's configuration file. By setting a lower percentage value for the parameter, you can reduce the risk of a cluster-wide outage if the outage impacts the small percentage of nodes that are receiving the policy application.

* If you set the `maxUnavailable` parameter to `50%` in two NNCP manifests, the policy configuration coverage applies to 100% of the nodes in your cluster. 

* When a node restarts, the Kubernetes NMState Operator cannot control the order to which it applies policies to nodes. The Kubernetes NMState Operator might apply interdependent policies in a sequence that results in a degraded network object.

* Consider specifying all related network configurations in a single policy.
