= Configuring storage throughput for gp3 drives

[role="_abstract"]
You can configure the throughput of gp3 drives when configuring an {aws-short} compute machine set. Increasing the throughput can improve performance for high traffic services.

.Prerequisites

* You use gp3 storage volume(s).

.Procedure

* On the machine set that you want to configure throughput, add the `throughputMib` parameter:

`<throughput_value>`:: Specifies a value in MiB/s between 125 and 2,000. This value can only be modified on gp3 volumes. The default value is 125.
