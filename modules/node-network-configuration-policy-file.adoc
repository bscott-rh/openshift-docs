= The NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy manifest file

A `NodeNetworkConfigurationPolicy` (NNCP) manifest file defines policies that the Kubernetes NMState Operator uses to configure networking for nodes that exist in an {product-title} cluster. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you want to apply multiple NNCP CRs to a node, you must create the NNCPs in a logical order that is based on the alphanumeric sorting of the policy names. The Kubernetes NMState Operator continuously checks for a newly created NNCP CR so that the Operator can instantly apply the CR to node. Consider the following logical order issue example:

. You create NNCP 1 for defining the bridge interface that listens on a VLAN port, such as `eth1.1000`.
. You create NNCP 2 for defining the VLAN interface and specify the port for this interface, such as `eth1.1000`.
. You apply NNCP 1 before you apply NNCP 2 to the node.

The node experiences a node connectivity issue because port `eth1.1000` does not exist. As a result, the cluster fails.
====

After you apply a node network policy to a node, the Kubernetes NMState Operator configures the networking configuration for nodes according to the node network policy details. 

You can create an NNCP by using either the {oc-first} or the {product-title} web console. As a postinstallation task you can create an NNCP or edit an existing NNCP.

[NOTE]
====
Before you create an NNCP, ensure that you read the "Example policy configurations for different interfaces" document.
====

If you want to delete an NNCP, you can use the `oc delete nncp` command to complete this action. However, this command does not delete any objects, such as a bridge interface. 

Deleting the node network policy that added an interface to a node does not change the configuration of the policy on the node. Similarly, removing an interface does not delete the policy, because the Kubernetes NMState Operator re-adds the removed interface whenever a pod or a node is restarted.

To effectively delete the NNCP, the node network policy, and any interfaces would typically require the following actions:

. Edit the NNCP and remove interface details from the file. Ensure that you do not remove `name`, `state`, and `type` parameters from the file.
. Add `state: absent` under the `interfaces.state` section of the NNCP.
. Run `oc apply -f <nncp_file_name>`. After the Kubernetes NMState Operator applies the node network policy to each node in your cluster, any interface that exists on each node is now marked as _absent_. 
. Run `oc delete nncp` to delete the NNCP.
