= Creating a cluster with multi-architecture compute machines on {gcp-short}

toc::[]

To create a {gcp-first} cluster with multi-architecture compute machines, you must first create a single-architecture {gcp-short} installer-provisioned cluster with the multi-architecture installer binary. For more information on AWS installations, refer to xref:../../installing/installing_gcp/installing-gcp-customizations.adoc[Installing a cluster on {gcp-short} with customizations]. You can then add ARM64 compute machines sets to your {gcp-short} cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Secure booting is currently not supported on ARM64 machines for {gcp-short}
